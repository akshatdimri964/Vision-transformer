Dataset used:- CIFAR-10 
Increasingly a more robust architecture has been the Transform Perception Architecture 
(ViT) which utilizes transformer based models towards computer based tasks that were 
primarily for natural language. Opposite of the traditional CNNs, the models of ViT are built 
differently since image patches are regarded as sequences of tokens. This helps in the 
effective representation of long range correlations in the image. Our focus in this paper is to 
extend the application of ViT to CIFAR-10, the most frequently used image classification 
benchmarking data set. Open source datasets like the CIFAR-10 consists of 60000 32×34 
color image in 10 classes making it appropriate for this level of processing. 
In this approach, the given input image is divided into patches, the patches are flattened and 
this tokenization concept is followed with every patch going inside a transformer encoder. At 
the end, the images or to be specific, these tokens are passed through many layers of 
transformers for encoders with self-attention mechanism to comprehend the entire image 
followed, then MLP, classification is done. The clean ViT model is assessed against dual setup 
CNN based models on the given dataset. 
While it has shown that these models require a lot of patience with vision transformers, 
experimental results have shown that vision transformers without any augmentation or 
complex training techniques can still perform reasonably well against comparatively trained 
models on the nad cifar-10. 
Objective:- 
The main goal of this project is to investigate the applicability and performance of the Vision 
Transformer (ViT) architectures for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
More specifically, goals are: 
Implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT): 
To design and construct a Vision Transformer model for the purposes of Image classification. 
That is to say becoming end to end computer vision with the transformer architecture 
adapted from the natural language processing domain. This entails decomposing the CIFAR
10 images into smaller patches and using these as input tokens in the transformer model. 
Introduction:- 
Deep learning is a crucial development to computer vision where the c, from the 
understanding of complex spatial relations, architecture are taken over by ‘Convolutional 
Neural Networks’ Security including image classification, segmentation and Identification. 
The biggest strength of CNNs has been their feature of using convolutional layers to model 
and extract local features in a layered manner. However, CNNs have drawbacks in the long
range dependencies that they are able to capture within images especially, tasks that need 
knowledge of the image structure as a whole. 
More recently, various computer vision targets proved themselves for the extensions of the 
complex multipliers including Vision Transformers ViTs of any sorts and kinds of various 
structural units and mechanisms that isolate and delineate various parts of the image and 
act within all of them and even beyond without obstructions of distances or any near 
proximity limits. Affect administration system without impacting the complete 
administration procedure to this end, it has been noted that instead of introducing 
Convolutional networks, ViT first dissects the images into patches of predetermined 
dimensions and considers them as a sequence, much like words for nlp tasks. 
This project implements the Vision Transformers architecture onto the datasets of CIFAR-10, 
consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images. CIFAR-10 is one of the benchmark dataset for 
image classification. The data is packed in a small but demanding image classification 
benchmarking due to it’s became up low resolution and small image size 
Methodology:- 
The methodology for applying the Vision Transformer (ViT) to the CIFAR-10 dataset consists 
of several steps, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation. 
Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps involved: 
1. Data Preprocessing: 
Dataset: 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images split into 50,000 training images 
and 10,000 test images, covering 10 distinct classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, 
dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck). 
Normalization: 
The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1], depending on the 
chosen transformer architecture and optimization strategy. Typically, each channel (R, G, B) 
is normalized using the dataset’s mean and standard deviation values. 
Patch Embedding: 
Since the Vision Transformer processes images as sequences of patches, each 32x32 image is 
split into smaller non-overlapping patches (e.g., 4x4 or 8x8 pixels). These patches are 
f
 lattened and transformed into 1D vectors. For example, for a 4x4 patch, the dimensionality 
is  
4 
× 
4 
× 
3 
= 
48 
4×4×3=48 for RGB channels. 
Positional Encoding: 
To provide the model with information about the relative position of patches, a positional 
encoding is added to each patch embedding. This encoding allows the transformer to retain 
spatial information, which is essential for image understanding. 
2. Vision Transformer (ViT) Architecture: 
Patch Embedding Layer: 
The flattened patches from the CIFAR-10 images are linearly projected into a higher
dimensional space (e.g., 768 dimensions). This layer outputs a sequence of embeddings 
representing each image patch. 
Transformer Encoder Layers: 
The core of the Vision Transformer consists of multiple transformer encoder layers. Each 
layer contains: 
Multi-Head Self-Attention: This mechanism enables the model to focus on different parts of 
the image simultaneously, capturing relationships between distant patches. 
Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN): Following the self-attention layers, a fully 
connected feed-forward network is applied to the output. This helps with learning complex 
representations. 
Layer Normalization and Residual Connections: Normalization layers and residual 
connections are used to stabilize training and improve convergence. 
Class Token: 
A learnable "class token" is prepended to the patch sequence. This token aggregates 
information from all patches through the transformer layers and is used as the final 
representation for image classification. 
Positional Encoding: 
To maintain the spatial structure of the image patches, learnable or fixed positional 
encodings are added to the patch embeddings at each transformer layer. 
MLP Head: 
After passing through the transformer layers, the final representation (usually the class 
token) is passed to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head with a softmax activation function 
for classification into 10 classes. 
3. Training Strategy: 
Loss Function: 
The model is trained using the cross-entropy loss function, which is standard for multi-class 
classification problems. 
Optimizer: 
The AdamW optimizer (Adam with weight decay) is commonly used for training transformers 
due to its efficiency and performance in handling large models. 
Learning Rate Scheduling: 
A learning rate scheduler, such as the cosine annealing schedule or warmup followed by 
decay, is applied to help the model converge more smoothly. 
Batch Size and Epochs: 
Given the relatively small size of CIFAR-10, a moderate batch size (e.g., 128 or 256) and a 
training schedule of 100-200 epochs is used, depending on model convergence and 
performance. 
Data Augmentation: 
To enhance model generalization, basic data augmentation techniques such as random 
cropping, flipping, and color jittering are applied during training. More advanced techniques 
like Cutout or MixUp can also be used to improve robustness. 
4. Evaluation: 
Validation and Testing: 
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation and test sets using 
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy is the primary metric of 
interest for this classification task. 
Comparison with Baseline CNN Models: 
To evaluate the effectiveness of ViT on CIFAR-10, its performance is compared against 
baseline CNN architectures, such as ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet. The goal is to determine 
whether ViT can achieve competitive or superior results on CIFAR-10. 
Ablation Studies: 
To understand the impact of different components on model performance, ablation studies 
are conducted. These may include varying patch sizes, testing different numbers of 
transformer layers, and comparing the effect of different positional encoding schemes. 
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Patch Size: 
Experimentation is done with different patch sizes (e.g., 4x4, 8x8) to identify the optimal size 
for capturing meaningful image features while preserving computational efficiency. 
Number of Transformer Layers and Attention Heads: 
The number of transformer layers and attention heads is varied to balance model complexity 
and performance. Deeper transformers may be more effective for larger datasets but can 
overfit on small datasets like CIFAR-10 without proper regularization. 
Regularization Techniques: 
Dropout and layer normalization are used to regularize the model and prevent overfitting, 
especially when training with smaller datasets like CIFAR-10.
